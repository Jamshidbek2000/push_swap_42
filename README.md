# Push Swap

## What is the project about?
The task is to sort numbers using 2 stacks. But, only with operations allowed on stack: `push`, `swap`, `rotate`, `reverse rotate`. Programming language must be C.

## What have I learned and liked implementing the project?
* Enjoyed implementing Stack data structure on my own.
* Finding an algorithm best for the requirenment.

## Instructions for running
1. make
2. ./push_swap "5 12 1 44 88 121 ..." (this will print which steps will sort the sequence)

To check if the sequence will be sorted: (checker was made for Mac)
1. ./push_swap "5 12 1 44 88 121 ..." | ./checker_Mac "5 12 1 44 88 121 ..." (it will output if it was sorted or not)
